What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that was being solved was designing and developing a course planner that included courses and their prerequisites.  The planner consisted of functions to load course data from a file, organize the data and display data. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by designing the code by creating pseudocode and researching on what data structure would be most efficient for this program. Based on my analysis I chose the hash table data structure which allowed for quick insertion, deletion and retrieval of course information.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs by teaching me the importance of choosing the most efficient data structure and performing analysis to make an informed decision. This approach has taught me how to optimize software design and development for efficiency and scalability. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project has evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable and adaptable by exercising good coding practices such as adding detailed comments, using human friendly variable names and consistent indentation.
